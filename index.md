# Hello! I'm Advait Risbud

I am a PhD student in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Chicago. Previously, I graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay with Bachelors in Metallurgical Engineering and Materials Science and a Masters in Chemistry. My research interests are broadly in the areas of ultrafast molecular spectroscopy, quantum dynamics, and biophysics. 

To learn more about my research experience please check out my [CV](/_pages/cv.md). When not thinking about science, I enjoy playing the guitar, reading, playing football, and long-distance running.
