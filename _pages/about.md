# Hello! I'm Advait Risbud

Dear Cyber Visitor, 

Welcome! My name is Advait Risbud and I am final-year student at IIT Bombay pursuing a Bachelor's in Materials Science and Master's in Chemistry. I will be joining the University of Chicago in the Fall of 2025 for a PhD in Chemistry. My interests lie in the domains of light-matter interaction, molecular spectroscopy, and biophysical chemistry. I am interested in elucidating molecular mechanism in biology and quantum materials science using novel spectroscopic and microscopic tools. I am currently pursuing my master's thesis project in the lab of Prof. Arindam Chowdhury at IIT Bombay working on single-molecule FRET and using it to learn the potential energy landscape of biomolecular conformational changes in intramolecular and intermolecular processes.

As a part of my Bachelor's project, I worked in Dr. Kasturi Saha's PQuest lab in the electrical engineering department at IIT Bombay. My work involved the usage of NV-centre-based quantum metrology setups for magnetometry in biological systems. I have worked with confocal microscopy as well T-1 relaxometry of colour centers. 

I spent the summer of 2023 in the Solarspec Laboratory at the University of British Columbia, Okanagan under the supervision of Dr. Robert Godin in the Department of Chemistry. My work was comprised of using various spectroscopy techniques (UV-vis, TCSPC, FT-IR, TAS) to probe the charge-carrier dynamics inside organic semiconductors.  

I enjoy playing football, table tennis, and the guitar in my free time. You can learn more about the projects I have been a part of under the projects tab. 

Feel free to reach out to discuss any of the above :)
